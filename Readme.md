***Bitcoin Price tracker***

**Input your item and how much you bought it for in USD to see how much BTC you spent.**
The ultimate goal of this program is to source people from around the world to provide on-the-ground real-time data on pricing of various goods. This will create a table that averages the prices in terms of bitcoin, thus creatting a commodity price chart that is crowd-sourced, decentralized, and based in a decentralized, deflationary currency. this will allow users to track inflation in their currency of choice against any and all goods and against bitcoin. 

**to use**
install and run json server to get a local server up and running. run index.html on a local server, this will load the api with some commodity data, and allow you to input your own data, calculating the price of your input in bitcoin.
